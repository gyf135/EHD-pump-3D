# EHD-pump-3D

Wet node Neumann boundaries for Phi
Bounce back for other variables
Phi is solved using LBM with a much larger CFL (dt) to accelerate convergence

The model is described in this paper: Vázquez, P. A., M. Talmor, J. Seyed-Yagoobi, P. Traoré, and M. Yazdani. "In-depth description of electrohydrodynamic conduction pumping of dielectric liquids: Physical model and regime analysis." Physics of Fluids 31, no. 11 (2019): 113601.
